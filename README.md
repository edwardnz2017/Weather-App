I created a weather app with a nice interface, it is simple and clean.

I decided to go with a light blue and bright yellow contrast to make the application feel brighter and so that it resembles the blue sky and sun.

This was my first time using an API, specifically OpenWeatherMap. With this API, you can search for any city in the world, and you will get the weather conditions and temperature in either metric or imperial depending on your selection. 

Please let me know if you have any feedback! Thanks
